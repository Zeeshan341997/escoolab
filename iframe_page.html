                <p>Biology is the scientific study of life.
                It is a natural science with a broad scope but
                has several unifying themes that tie it together
                as a single, coherent field. For instance,
                all organisms are made up of cells that process
                hereditary information encoded in genes, which can 
                be transmitted to future generations.</p>

                <p>Physics is the natural science that studies matter,
                its motion and behavior through space and time, and the 
                related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of 
                the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its 
                main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.</p>

                <p>Chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, 
                composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), 
                the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is 
                released or absorbed during these processes</p>
